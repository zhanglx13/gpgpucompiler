Install the compiler in the linux:
1. Install JDK 1.6
2. Set variables in the file nvcc.sh. If the NVCC wasn't set up correctly, dead loop may happen. 
	CUDA_HOME: cuda path
3. Make the file nvcc.sh executable. (chmod 777 nvcc.sh)
4. Go to "test" folder and run the *.sh files . 
	For example, "sh test_matmul.sh". It will generate output files into matmul/output/.
5. The "cuda" folder includes the executable test cases, which have the outputs generated by the compiler. You need to put them into CUDA SDK to run the test cases.
